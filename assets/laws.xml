						each official meeting of a public body shall be open
						to the
						public, and any person is entitled to attend such a
						meeting.
					</li>
					<li>As used in this Article, "public body" means any elected or
						appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council, or
						other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities,
						school administrative units, constituent institutions of The
						University of North Carolina, or other political subdivisions or
						public corporations in the State that (i) is composed of two or
						more members and (ii) exercises or is authorized to exercise a
						legislative, policy-making, quasi-judicial, administrative, or
						advisory function. In addition, "public body" means the governing
						board of a "public hospital" as defined in G.S. 159‑39 and the
						governing board of any nonprofit corporation to which a hospital
						facility has been sold or conveyed pursuant to G.S. 131E‑8, any
						subsidiary of such nonprofit corporation, and any nonprofit
						corporation owning the corporation to which the hospital facility
						has been sold or conveyed.</li>
					<li>"Public body" does not include (i) a meeting solely among the
						professional staff of a public body, or (ii) the medical staff of
						a public hospital or the medical staff of a hospital that has been
						sold or conveyed pursuant to G.S. 131E‑8.</li>
					<li>"Official meeting" means a meeting, assembly, or gathering
						together at any time or place or the simultaneous communication by
						conference telephone or other electronic means of a majority of
						the members of a public body for the purpose of conducting
						hearings, participating in deliberations, or voting upon or
						otherwise transacting the public business within the jurisdiction,
						real or apparent, of the public body. However, a social meeting or
						other informal assembly or gathering together of the members of a
						public body does not constitute an official meeting unless called
						or held to evade the spirit and purposes of this Article.</li>
					<li>Every public body shall keep full and accurate minutes of all
						official meetings, including any closed sessions held pursuant to
						G.S. 143‑318.11. Such minutes may be in written form or, at the
						option of the public body, may be in the form of sound or video
						and sound recordings. When a public body meets in closed session,
						it shall keep a general account of the closed session so that a
						person not in attendance would have a reasonable understanding of
						what transpired. Such accounts may be a written narrative, or
						video or audio recordings. Such minutes and accounts shall be
						public records within the meaning of the Public Records Law, G.S.
						132‑1 et seq.; provided, however, that minutes or an account of a
						closed session conducted in compliance with G.S. 143‑318.11 may be
						withheld from public inspection so long as public inspection would
						frustrate the purpose of a closed session. (1979, c. 655, s. 1;
						1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 932, s. 4; 1991, c. 694, ss. 1, 2;

						1997‑290, s. 1; 1997‑456, s. 27; 2011‑326, s. 8.)</li>

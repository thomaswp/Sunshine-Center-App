			<q>What are considered public records in NC local governments?</q>
			<an>
				With very few exceptions, all records created or received by
				officials and employees while transacting official government
				business are public records and must be retained, stored, disposed
				of, and made available for inspection and copying in accordance with
				the law. This applies to records in officials’ and employees’ homes
				and on home or personal computers if the record pertains to
				government business. The public records law is primarily contained
				in N.C.G.S.132-1 through N.C.G.S. 132-10, which is on-line at:
				<a
					href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByChapter/Chapter_132.html">
					http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByChapter/Chapter_132.html
				</a>
				.
				<br />
				Public records include paper and electronic documents (including
				emails
				and other electronic messages), photos, videos, maps, computer
				files, computer communications and voice mail messages. Unless the
				purpose and content of a record is personal in nature and not
				related to the transaction of local government business, then it is
				a public record and should be managed according to the Records
				<a href="http://www.records.ncdcr.gov/local/">Retention and Disposition Schedule</a>
				("Schedule"), if your governing
				board has adopted this Schedule. If
				your governing board has not
				adopted this Schedule, then you must
				retain all records about your
				government forever.
				<br />
				There are certain records that are exempted from the definition of
				public records, and there are certain public records that do not
				have to be disclosed.
			</an>
			<q anchor="whoOwns">Who owns public records in NC local government?</q>
			<an>NC local government public records and public information are
				the
				property of the people. Employees and officials are records
				custodians, and are responsible for retaining these records and
				making them available to the public when they request them. </an>
			<q>Who is responsible for keeping local government records?</q>
			<an>The public official in charge of an office is designated to be
				the custodian of records for that office (N.C.G.S. § 132-2).
				Practically, each official and employee is responsible for
				retaining
				the public records in his or her possession. For example,
				if you work
				in a particular department and you send/receive emails
				about official
				government business, you’re responsible for
				retaining them for the
				appropriate retention period, unless your
				local government has
				established policies that direct others to be
				responsible for
				retaining them.</an>
			<q>Who may request local government public records?</q>
			<an>Anyone</an>
		</header>
		<header title="Records Management, Retention and Disposition">
			<q>Do I have to keep every record I send/receive about local
				government business forever?</q>
			<an>
				If your governing board has adopted the
				<a href="http://www.records.ncdcr.gov/local/">Retention and Disposition Schedule</a>
				(Schedule), then you may likely dispose of
				records after they’ve
				exceeded the retention period outlined in that
				document. However, we
				must retain all records that are subject to
				litigation, audits, or
				that have outstanding requests pertaining to
				them even after they’ve
				exceeded the retention period. You must keep
				these records until the
				outstanding action is resolved. And, in some
				local governments,
				accreditation agencies may require you to keep
				certain records for a
				longer period of time. Always work with your
				supervisor or legal
				staff if you have any questions.
				<br />
				If your governing board has not adopted the Records Retention and
				Disposition Schedule, then you must keep all records about local
				government business forever – you may not dispose of anything.
			</an>
			<q>How do I know how long I need to keep records? </q>
			<an>
				Refer to the
				<a href="http://www.records.ncdcr.gov/local/">Retention and Disposition Schedule</a>
				, which
				describes the minimum retention period.
				<br />
				It's good to set aside time once a year for records management
				duties (making decisions about what files to keep and purge
				according to the Records Retention and Disposition Schedule).
				<br />
				Remember, records must be retained if there is an outstanding record
				request, court subpoena or court order, some state or federal law or
				grant requirement, if litigation is pending or threatened or if
				there is any other outstanding action pertaining to the record.
				<br />
				And, even if the record has surpassed the minimum retention period,
				if it’s an active record that you use in your duties, then keep it
				as long as it’s useful to you.
			</an>
			<q>How long do I keep emails and other types of electronic messages I
				sent/receive about local government business?</q>
			<an>
				Emails and any other type of electronic messages are just as much
				“official” records as paper records. The content of the electronic
				message determines its record series status according to the Records
				<a href="http://www.records.ncdcr.gov/local/">Retention and Disposition Schedule</a>
				.
				It’s a good practice to develop
				good electronic message folder
				systems to
				ensure easy retrieval of
				these messages, instead of keeping
				them in
				your inbox and sent box.
				As with your paper records, if an
				email is
				transitory, then you
				likely do not need to retain it once it
				no
				longer has value to you.
				<br />
				You should segregate confidential and protected electronic messages
				from others messages so you don’t inadvertently release them in
				response to a public records request.
			</an>
			<q>How should I file my emails and other electronic messages to
				ensure easy retrieval when I need them to respond to a record
				request?</q>
			<an>Create electronic message file folders just as you would paper
				file folders. An electronic message file system should follow the
				same philosophy as a paper file system. For example, you may file
				general emails by calendar or fiscal years; you may develop subject
				folder systems, etc.</an>
			<q>What are transitory records?</q>
			<an>
				Transitory records are records that are ephemeral, temporary, or
				transient in nature and have only short-term administrative value.
				<br />
				Transitory records are public records, but because of their nature,
				they do not typically have to be retained. Transitory records
				include (but are not limited to) messages with short-term or no
				administrative value, such as many, but not all, voice mails,
				self-sticking notes, facsimile cover sheets that do not contain
				substantive information, and telephone messages. Transitory records
				are created primarily for the informal communication of information
				and not to perpetuate or formalize knowledge. Transitory records do
				not set policy, establish guidelines or procedures, discuss a local
				government business matter, discuss a decision, certify a
				transaction, or act as evidence of receipt. (Certified or registered
				mail return receipts that contain important information about the
				names of the sender/recipient and pertinent dates are not
				transitory.) Transitory records may be treated as having a reference
				or administrative value that ends when you no longer need the
				information in the record. Transitory records may be purged when
				their reference value ends unless there is some other reason that
				record should be retained, such as an outstanding record request,
				court subpoena or court order, some state or federal law or grant
				requirement, or if litigation is pending or threatened. However, if
				a record request is received for a transitory record before that
				transitory record has been purged, that transitory record must be
				disclosed.
			</an>
			<q>What are the appropriate methods of destroying records after the
				time period for keeping those records has expired (according to the
				Records Retention and Disposition Schedule)?</q>
			<an>
				If the governing board has adopted the
				<a href="http://www.records.ncdcr.gov/local/">Retention and Disposition Schedule</a>
				(Schedule), then after records have surpassed
				the retention period,
				we may dispose of them as allowed by N.C.
				Administrative Code, Title
				7, Chapter 4, Subchapter M, Section .0510
				(except those records that
				are the subject of litigation, audits or
				any outstanding actions):
				<br />
				We should shred paper records that contain confidential, protected
				or secure information with a crosscut shredder. We may recycle paper
				records that do not contain confidential, sensitive or secure
				information, as long as the contract with the recycling provider
				stipulates that recycled materials will not be resold as documents
				or records.
				<br />
				If the governing board has not adopted the Records Retention and
				Disposition Schedule, then you may not destroy any of your records.
			</an>
			<q>Is it ok for me to maintain government records on my personal
				computer?</q>
			<an>
				We should not maintain government records on personal computers or
				devices. Maintain all government records on the local government
				computer/device. This will ensure that we’re never in a position of
				being asked to provide or search personal technology to satisfy a
				record request.
				<br />
				Likewise, it's best to maintain personal records on personal
				devices. If it's important to maintain a personal record on a
				government device for a brief period of time (and if the local
				government allows this), then create a separate folder for these
				personal records. Delete personal records when they’re no longer
				needed from the government issued device.
			</an>
		</header>
		<header title="Responding to Record Requests">
			<q>I've just received a records request. What do I do? </q>
			<an>
				First, it’s helpful to adopt a public servant attitude and treat
				records requests as part of our jobs in local government. This is
				one part of our job that is required by state law, which elevates
				the importance of this job duty. Do not consider record requests as
				interruptions that prevent us from performing our other duties.
				Then, take the next step and let’s put the smile on our faces, which
				will also be heard in our voices. Let’s strive to provide excellent
				customer service when we’re asked for public records.
				Second, notify
				the supervisor. It's possible that other employees and
				officials in
				the local government have received the same request.
				Good
				communication is critical to ensure everyone operates as
				efficiently
				as possible.
				<br />
				As a courtesy, we should respond promptly to the requesting party to
				let them know we’ve received the request. Ask the person any
				clarifying questions about the records sought. It's also helpful to
				ask if the person has made this request to other staff members as
				well. This will ensure everyone can be as efficient as possible.
				Advise the requesting party that we’ll search our records and get
				back with them by a certain date (and give them the date) to let
				them know any cost for providing those records (based on the format
				they've requested). Ask if they concur with this plan.
			</an>
			<q>What CAN’T local government employees or officials require of
				persons requesting public records? </q>
			<an>
				We can’t require the request to be made in writing (except that
				requests for databases may be required in writing). If it’s a
				complicated request, we may ask the requester to put it in writing
				to help us understand it. However, if the requester refuses to do
				so, then we must fulfill the request and ask clarifying questions to
				make sure we understand the request.
				<br />
				We can’t require the requester provide his/her name or other
				personal identifying information. Some local governments may request
				that persons requesting records complete a form (paper or on-line).
				It’s fine to ask someone to complete such a form, but we may not
				require it.
				<br />
				We can’t charge the requester for “inspecting” records.
				<br />
				For most record requests, we can’t charge more than actual cost to
				produce the record. For example, if it takes an employee one hour to
				produce the records, that employee may not charge for his/her time.
				That employee may charge the cost of the paper required for
				photocopying, the cost of the CD/DVD, etc. If the record request
				will require extensive local government resources (overtime,
				contractual services, etc.), then we should work with our
				supervisors and the person requesting the records to agree on
				decisions for moving forward.
			</an>
			<q>How should records be searched in response to a record request?
			</q>
			<an>
				Unless the record request only specifies emails/electronic messages,
				then we must search ALL of our records (including paper and
				electronic).
				<br />
				For emails/electronic messages, it's important to input the
				appropriate search criteria to make sure we’re providing, to the
				best of our ability, all records in our possession in response to a
				record request.
				<br />
				Let's use the following example. An employee gets a record request
				for all records in his/her possession from January 1 of current year
				through February 28 of current year pertaining to solid waste
				pick-up complaints.
				<ul>
					<li>First, remember to check paper files, because the record
						request didn't specify only emails.</li>
					<li>Next, think of all the search criteria that might be
						applicable. For example, search for the word "solid waste". It
						would also be a good idea to search for the words "garbage" and
						even "trash”. Don't forget the time period of the request is
						January 1 of current year through February 28 of current year. The
						employee doesn’t need to provide records prior to or after that
						time period to satisfy that request. (It sure is helpful if the
						employee has filed emails in folders according to calendar or
						fiscal years!)</li>
					<li>Finally, in responding to the record request, the employee
						should state that he/she has searched of records, and to the best
						of the employee’s knowledge, is providing the records that satisfy
						the request. We’re all human, and humans make mistakes. It’s
						possible that the employee received an email about garbage
						collection, but garbage was misspelled. If so, a key word search
						for the word “garbage” (spelled correctly) would not find an email
						with the misspelled word. The employee didn’t intentionally
						withhold a record, and using the phrase "to the best of your
						knowledge" explains that the employee’s did his/her best at
						searching for records to respond to the request.</li>
					<li>If it's a complex records request, then the employee may also
						want to share the list of key word searches used to search records
						with the requesting party and give them an opportunity to add
						additional key words to the search criteria. </li>
					<li>It’s a good practice to close the loop on records request by
						confirming with the requester that they are satisfied that the
						employee has fulfilled the request and they consider it complete.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</an>
			<q>How should records be provided in response to a record request?
			</q>
			<an>
				If we have questions about any of our records being confidential,
				protected or secure or having information in them that may be
				confidential, protected or secure, we should contact our legal staff
				prior to releasing these records. For more, see
				<a href="record://holders.protectedRecords">Protected Records</a>.
				<ol type="A">
					<li>If the requesting party has requested emails stored
						electronically, then we can provide them electronically according
						to email system.</li>
					<li>
						If the requesting party has requested information in paper
						format,
						or if the records the person has requested are only in
						paper
						format, then we might consider one of the following options:
						<br />
						<ol>
							<li>Make an appointment for the requesting party to come to the
								office and review the paper records. (NOTE: The employee might
								choose to open his/her files for the requested time period to
								the
								person, and it would be the responsibility of the person
								making
								the request to look through these files.) The requesting
								party
								could mark the pages to copy, and the employee would then
								let
								the
								person know the charge for these copies. Once the person
								agreed
								to the charges and authorized the copies, we would either
								make
								the copies at that time (especially if it's a small request)
								or
								let the person know when the copies would be available for
								pick-up (especially if it's a large copy request).</li>
							<li>Go through paper files, pull the records that apply to the
								request, and advise the person making the request of the copy
								charges. If the person authorizes copying the records, then let
								them know when they'll be available for pick-up. If the person
								does not authorize the copies, then they may make an appointment
								to come in and review the records and then choose which ones
								they'd like us to copy. If they come in and review the records,
								then the requesting party could mark the pages to copy, and the
								employee would then let the person know the charge for these
								copies. Once the person agreed to the charges and authorized the
								copies, we would either make the copies at that time (especially
								if it's a small request) or let the person know when the copies
								would be available for pick-up (especially if it's a large copy
								request).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</an>
			<q>How much time do I have to respond to a record request?</q>
			<an>NC law states we must respond within a reasonable amount of time.
				Keeping in mind that this is one way we serve the public and it is a
				job duty required by law, we should make records requests a priority
				when we receive them. If it’s a simple request and we can
				accommodate it in a few minutes, then do so. If it’s a more complex
				request and it will take time and we have other high priority work,
				then develop an action plan showing when we can fulfill the request,
				and share this action plan with the supervisor and then with the
				requesting party. If the requesting party wants the information
				sooner, then that’s when we have the conversation with the
				supervisor about extensive resources that might be required to
				fulfill the request. Then we’d share information with the requester
				for his/her concurrence, including the cost to them of the extensive
				resources if they want the records in a shorter amount of time than
				what is reasonable.</an>
			<q>What do I do if I get a record request for copyrighted records?
			</q>
			<an>We may have records that contain copyrighted material and are
				protected by copyright laws. If a record request is made for a
				record that is protected by copyright, then make the record
				available to the requester for inspection. If the requester requests
				a copy, then point out to the requesting party that the record
				contains copyrighted materials, but allow the requester to copy the
				record themselves. Government employees and officials should not
				copy records known to be copyrighted.</an>
			<q>Is a draft record a public record that I must share if I get a
				request for it?</q>
			<an>
				Once a draft document has been shared with another, it is a public
				record and is subject to public inspection. Inspection may be
				required for some uncirculated drafts. Consult with legal staff
				about the public record status of a draft document prior to denying
				inspection of that document.
				<br />
				To avoid misunderstandings that can sometimes arise from public
				circulation of discussion drafts, consider labeling each page of
				draft documents that you circulate to others with "DISCUSSION DRAFT
				ONLY."
			</an>
			<q>How do I know what to charge for producing records for someone?
			</q>
			<an>
				The law permits local governments to charge a fee for reproducing a
				record that recovers the actual cost of duplicating the record. Some
				local governmenst may include these fees as part of their fiscal
				year budgets. An estimate of the charges should be given to the
				requester and the requester’s approval obtained prior to reproducing
				records.
				<br />
				In rare cases, providing public records may require extensive use of
				information technology resources or clerical and/or supervisory
				assistance. In these cases, the record custodian may assess a
				reasonable service charge based on the actual incurred costs. An
				estimate of the charges should be given to the requester and
				approval obtained prior to reproducing records.
				<br />
				It’s important to be consistent and equitable throughout our local
				government organization with the fees we charge for reproducing
				records. Do not pick charge different amounts on a person-by-person
				basis.
			</an>
			<q>Do I charge someone for providing them records on a CD/DVD? </q>
			<an>We may recover the cost of the CD/DVD.</an>
			<q>Do I have to create a record to satisfy a record request if a
				record doesn't already exist?</q>
			<an>We do not have to create a new record to satisfy a record
				request. Instead, we may respond that we have no record that
				satisfies the request.</an>
			<q>Am I allowed to deny a record request?</q>
			<an>Yes, under certain circumstances (i.e., the record may be
				protected, etc.). Always consult with legal staff before denying a
				record request.</an>
		</header>
		<header title="Protected Records">
			<q>How do I know if a record is protected and I shouldn't share it
				with others?</q>
			<an>
				A protected record is a record that is exempted from the definition
				of public records and a record for which there is statutory or other
				authority permitting or requiring that the information not be
				disclosed.
				<br />
				Protected records should not be disclosed, and in some cases must
				not be disclosed, without the permission of the official custodian
				or legal staff. Just as we have a duty to disclose public records,
				we have a duty to protect the privacy of protected records. In
				particular, a social security number must never be released as part
				of a public record. Make efforts not to include protected
				information and public information in the same record. Records that
				contain a mix of public records and protected records must be
				disclosed, but the protected information must first be removed (if
				on a separate page) or redacted (if on the same page with public
				information). When in doubt if a record is a protected record,
				consult with legal staff. Consulting with the attorney has
				advantages in the event we determine the record is protected and we
				do not disclose it, and there is a legal challenge.
			</an>
			<q>What are some examples of records that are exempted from public
				records?</q>
			<an>
				<ul>
					<li>Confidential communications from the attorney to the client
						within the scope of the attorney-client relationship as defined in

					<li>Other records for which statutory exemptions apply.</li>
				</ul>
			</an>

			<q>What are some examples of records protected from disclosure?</q>
			<an>
				<ul>
					<li>Personnel files of employees, which include any information
						gathered by the local government with respect to an employee are
						protected, except for the specific information that NCGS 160A-168
						requires to be public information.</li>
					<li>"Tax information" pertaining to a taxpayer's income or gross
						receipts may not be disclosed, as provided in

						except as provided in N.C.G.S. 160A-208.1. </li>
					<li>Social security numbers and personal "identifying information"
						is confidential and unlawful to disclose to the public. If a
						social
						security number is lawfully collected, it must be segregated
						on a

						the
						record, as provided in N.C.G.S. 132-1.10. (See also N.C.G.S.
						132.1.10, N.C.G.S. 75-61 and N.C.G.S. 14-113.20.)</li>
					<li>Trade secrets and electronic payment account numbers are
						protected as set forth in N.C.G.S. 132-1.2. (Note that to protect
						a

					</li>
					<li>Certain economic development incentives are temporarily
						protected, as provided in N.C.G.S. 132-1.11.</li>
				</ul>
			</an>
			<q>How do I redact protected information in the information I release
				in response to a record request?</q>
			<an>
				If a record subject to a record request is a protected record, we
				likely will not have to make that record available for inspection
				and copying. When in doubt if a record is a protected record,
				consult with legal staff. Consulting with the legal staff has
				advantages in the event we determine the record is protected and we
				do not disclose it, and there is a legal challenge.
				<br />
				In some cases, however, a public record will contain information
				that is protected, but the entire record is not protected. In those
				cases, the protected information should be deleted in a manner that
				shows that a deletion was made. For example, if the record is a
				paper record, then make a copy of the record, tape over the
				protected information with white correction tape, then use a black
				painter pen to completely mark over the tape. The marked up record
				should then be copied and the new redacted copy made available for
				inspection and copying.
				<br />
				If we are providing an electronic record that includes protected
				information that must be redacted, then consider saving the
				electronic document as a new file name, and from the new file, use
				the electronic "cut" feature to eliminate the protected text and
				show in the revised document where text has been "cut". It is the
				record custodian's responsibility to ensure that protected
				information remains protected.
